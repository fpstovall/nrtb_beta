NRTB is a reboot of the old "Real-Time Battle" a programming game where 
programmers developed control programs for combat robots armed with cannon in
a 2D arena. This version will use 3D physics, more or less accurate, as well 
as allow the control programes to interface wia a simplished ASCII TCP/IP interface.

Nothing is complete yet. Current development is focused on created a useful
alphe level simulation engine.

Currenly all development is focused in the cpp directory. Most of the rest are
considered obsolete and maintained for purely histerical purposes.
