NRTB is a reboot of the old "Real-Time Battle" a programming game where 
programmers developed control programs for combat robots armed with cannon in
a 2D arena. This version uses 3D physics, more or less accurate, as well 
as allow the control programes to interface wia a simplished ASCII TCP/IP interface.

While there is a running program this is very much a work in progress. The simulation engine runs and bot control programs can connect and run simplifed robots on on an infinite flat field. Collisions destroy all objects affected and no weapons systems work yet. Primary output is stored in a mongodb database and there are no visualization tools yet. 

Beta development is currently focused on cleanups and adding functionality. Currently all development is focused in the cpp directory. Most of the rest are
considered obsolete and maintained for purely histerical purposes.
