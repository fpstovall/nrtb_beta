Enter the command "make" at the top level to build everything. 

NRTB is a reboot of the old "Real-Time Battle" a programming game where programmers
developed control programs for combat robots armed with cannon. This version will use
3D physics, more or less accurate, as well allow the control programes to interface 
wia a simplished ASCII TCP/IP interface.

Currenly all development is focused in the cpp directory. Most of the rest are
considered obsolete and maintained for purely histerical purposes.
